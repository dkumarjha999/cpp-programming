# Competitive Programming Repository

This repository contains solutions, templates, and practice problems for competitive programming. It is created for learning coding and practice problems from contests such as Codeforces, LeetCode, HackerRank, and others.

## Contents

- **Algorithms**: Implementations of common algorithms (sorting, searching, graph algorithms, dynamic programming, etc.).
- **Data Structures**: Code for frequently used data structures (arrays, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, etc.).
- **Problem Solutions**: Solutions to problems from various online judges and contests.

## How to Use

- Browse by problem title or name.
- Use the code as reference or starting point for your own solutions.
- Practice by modifying and running the programs.

## Contributing

Feel free to contribute by adding new solutions, improving existing code, or sharing useful templates.
